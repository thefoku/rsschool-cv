# About me

I'm 28. Graduated from FEFU with a bachelor's degree and a master's degree in Infocommunication technologies of communication systems. Working as a technical support specialist for 3 years now, and learned a lot about web technologies, HTML & CSS. 

Since childhood was interested in IT. When I was 16 launched my own Lineage 2 game server locally with a friend, and since that I wanted to start a server online for everyone, it's my motivation to learn everything new.
About a year ago became learning different programming languages, and decided that I'm more interested in Front-end, so started learning JavaScript. 
I think Web Development, and development in general, allows you to create something new and bring all sorts of ideas to life. It opens up endless possibilities for creating projects that I myself will be interested in.

As a hobby, I love music of all kind, especially metalcore, hardcore, and other heavy genres. Playing guitar and drums.
In my free time I'm playing computer games, doing sports, walking with my dog.
